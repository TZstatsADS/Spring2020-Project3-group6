### [Full Project Description](doc/project3_desc.md)

Term: Spring 2020

+ Group number: 6

+ Team members
	+ Lee, Sol
	+ Ni, Jiayun
	+ Petkun, Michael 
	+ Schmidle, Daniel
	+ Zhang, Tianshu 

+ Project summary: In this project, we developed multiple classification models to perform facial emotion recognition. Comparing with a baseline model, our models have improved the test accuracy, computational cost, and storage size. The best model is particularly introduced to the class with the presentation.

[Contribution Statement] 

Daniel Schmidle, as a major contributor, involved in every stage of the project’s development and discussion. Daniel built individual base gbm model for project understanding, developed the PCA + SVM model as the advanced model, cross validated the advanced PCA+SVM model, and created/recorded the group’s project presentation. 

Michael Petkun, another major contributor, built the baseline model and compiled the Main.Rmd and Test_Day.Rmd files.

Tianshu Zhang actively participated in all meetings, contributed inputs in the model selection process, and built a CNN Resnet-18 model (Neural Network model).

Sol Lee organinzed recurring Zoom meetings, actively participated and contributed inputs in the model selection process, and built a SVM model. Sol edited Readme.md and organized the Github URL.

Jiayun Ni actively participated in all meetings, contributed inputs in the model selection process, and built a KNN+PCA model.

All team members contributed to the GitHub repository. All team members approve our work presented in our GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
